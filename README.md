### Introduction 
---
A simple, fictional restaurant app that leverages the power of webpack. It was completed for The Odin Porject in order to use webpack for bundling files and assets.  

### Technologies 
---
* Vanilla JS
* HTML5
* CSS3

### An Inside Look
---
* Vast majority of the app was generated using vanilla js
* All image and resource files are processed and bundled using webpack
* innerHTML was not used in any way to manipulate the DOM

### Inspiration 
---
My inspiration for "Big Mama T's Cafe" came from my both my experience with Big Mama Thornton's music and from eating soul food! I will never forget the first time I heard her version(the original) of "Hound Dog" and 
and saying to myself, "oh THIS is what it's supposed to sound like!".

On an aesthetic note, I wanted to front page to appear like an album cover. 

On a technical note, I could see the benefit of bundling with webpack, and I wanted to really dig in and give it a shot. All resources were handled with webpack loaders.

### Difficulties
---
There were some pretty epic difficulites in getting gh pages to properly display images while hosting the app. Finally, I realized that after updating/rebuilding
the app, the subtree 'gh-pages' itself, needed to be pushed (again) to github vs pushing the main branch and expecting some magic to happen.
